# Canvas-Stream

A [smart](#smart) and [small](#small) python module for downloading
the current favorite courses files from Canvas-LMS.

## Docker
You can also run this program using Docker, just run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name canvas-stream \
  -e URL="https://to.canvas.com" \
  -e ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token_here" \
  -e OUTPUT_PATH="canvas" \
  -e EXCLUDED_FORMATS='["mp4", "mp3"]' \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/canvas \
  --restart=always \
  canvas-stream-image

```

or using `docker-compose` by:
- copying `.env.example` to `.env`
- setting the environment variables in a `.env` file

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


## Setup

### Installation

Be sure to have python3 downloaded and in PATH.

First, add a `config.toml` file with the canvas `url`
and the API `access_token` (with is usually available at
`${url}/profile/settings#access_tokens`) like this:

```toml
url = 'https://to.canvas.com'
access_token = 'insert-random-chars-here' # API access token
output_path = 'canvas' # optional, default is 'canvas, can be absolute or relative to the current directory
excluded_formats = ["mp4"] # lower case extensions

[slug]
preset = '' # preset slug format: "snake_case", "kebab-case", "PascalCase"
lower = false # convert to lower case
separator = "-" # replace spaces with this character
ascii_only = true # remove non-ascii characters
capitalize = false # capitalize first letter of each word
```

Then run the following commands:

```ps1
python3 -m venv .venv

# on unix-like system
. .env/bin/activate
# on Windows
. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Then, run the program with:

```
python -m canvas_stream
# or if you installed uv
uv run -m canvas_stream
```

### Development

Adicionales requirements should be installed:

```ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

> This project uses type annotations, so enable or install [mypy][mypy]
> or other type checker extension (like [pylance][pylance]) to use useful
> suggestions and automatic reporting of errors with types âœ¨

Before committing, run the following commands:

```bash
black canvas_stream
mypy canvas_stream
pylint canvas_stream  # TODO: add linter config
```

## Notes

<!-- TODO: move this to docs/ -->

### Small

In comparison with other popular canvas files downloaders, like
[canvas_grab][canvas_grab] and [canvasFileSync][canvasFileSync],
this program doesn't have big or a lot of dependencies,
this module has only 2: `request` and `toml`.

The codebase is also small, at around 550 lines of code.

### Smart

It uses a mix of the GraphQL and the REST API with a sqlite3
database cache to fetch only stuff as needed.
After the first run, the fetch iteration should take a second.

Also, if the program is stopped, the next time it will continue
where it left and check additionally if there was an update in
the courses.


### Asome things to implement in the future

- [] Handle if a file is downloadable or not
- [] Download multiple files in the same time (async+await, threads poll?)
- [] Download files from Google Drive (see [`gdown`][gdown])
- [] Make url / links with common external urls pages (Wikipedia, YouTube, etc)
- [] Better logging (see [how to `logging`][hotto_logging])
- [] User configuration
- [] Better correlation with DB File and filesystem file
- [] Simple user interface (separated from the core code)
- [] Guide of how to install `python3` (Windows Store!)
- [] Guide on how to add the program to PATH, so it could be used everywhere
- [] Specify the format of file and courses names
- [x] Specify where to download the files
- [] Specify which courses to download or exclude
- [x] Specify which files (format such as .pdf) to exclude
